## Concurrency and Threads
* A **multi-threaded** program has more than one point of execution (i.e., multiple PCs, each of which is being fetched and executed from). They **share** the same address space and thus can access the same data.
* In a multi-threaded process, instead of a single stack in the address space, there will be one per thread.
